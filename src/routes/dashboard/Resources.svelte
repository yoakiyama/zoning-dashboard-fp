<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>
    We hope that navigating our visualization helped provide you with some insight into how your access to high-paying jobs may currently be limited. Perhaps
    you were surprised by how long of a commute you would have to the Boston city center if you wanted to keep your rent at a price you're comfortable with.
    Our goal in creating this visualization was to help Boston area residents understand how they may be paying for access to higher paying jobs, either
    directly via high rent prices, or indirectly by spending hours of each day commuting to and from work.
    By getting a high-level understanding of the interplay between rent prices, commute times, and available salaries, we hope you're left with some sense
    of how the current housing crisis in Boston might be affecting you personally.
</p>

<p>
    Today, more than half of the residents in Boston are considered rent burdened<sup><a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report">1</a></sup>,
    raising the question of what can be done to improve housing affordability and accessibility to all parts of Boston. While any solution that helps
    bring down housing costs or increase transit options will undoubtedly take a long time, every change has to start somewhere. It's easy to be wary
    of new legislations that change the status quo, but if we want to alleviate the current situation, we have to start somewhere, and we hope you might
    now be more motivated to think holistcally about future legislation before reacting critically. Below we list some current and proposed legislations
    if you're interested in learning more, but please also feel free to continue to explore the fully-featured dashboard by clicking on the "Dashboard"

   <a href="https://www.topa4ma.org/">Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA)</a>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A proposed state-wide bill that would give municipalities the ability to adopt a "tenant opportunity to purchase".
        </li>
        <li>
            This right would allow tenants to make a first offer to purchase property they live in when a landlord looks to sell the property,
            giving tenant associations the opportunity to collectively purchase their homes instead of being displaced in the event of a sale.
        </li>
        <li>
            While tenant opportunities to purchase are cost-neutral, i.e. they neither bring in revenue or require expenditure from the government,
            they can help maintain a stock of affordable housing.
        </li>
        <li>
            By allowing tenant associations to make offers on the buildings they live in, property owners can still sell their properties at
            fair market prices, but without the likely subsequent increase in rent costs that often comes with corporate ownership of rental
            properties.
        </li>
        <li>
            By prseserving stock of affordable housing and avoiding displacement of tenants, TOPA could help prevent rental cost increases,
            and in the long term be a valuable contributor to allowing individuals to live closer to their work while paying a reasonable rent.
