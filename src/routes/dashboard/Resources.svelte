<h2>Learn about how you can get involved</h2>
<p>
    Through this interactive dashboard, we hope you were able to explore the difficult trade-offs that Bostonians must consider when 
    finding housing that accomodates with their budget and commute time preferences. Given the ever increasing cost of rent and slow 
    development of public transportation, urban planners, politicians, and voters in our communities must come together to improve housing affordability and 
    public transportation in across the Boston area. Below, you can find a list of proposed 
    legislation and housing policies. In these links, you will also find ways to get involved.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mapc.org/get-involved/legislative-priorities/#housing">MAPC Legislative Priorities</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Metropolitan Area Planning Commission's (MAPC) housing legislative agenda includes initiatives and recommenations for updates to 
        housing construction, zoning, subsidies, transportation, and renter protections.</li>
    <li>Here, you can find important information about the MAPC's Fiscal and Budget Priorities, which include the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (MRVP) 
        and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The MRVP provides rent vouchers, which can be an important resource for highly 
        cost-burdened households (those who are paying over 50% of their income in rent) and homeless families. The MBTA is systematically underfunded, 
        which has led to widespread safety concerns as well as common and substantial delays. The MAPC will focus on advocating for additional funding for the MBTA 
        to address repairs and ensure regular service.

<p><a href="https://www.mbta.com/projects">Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) projects page</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Here, you can find all ongoing, recently completed, and contract awarded MBTA projects.</li>
    <li>You can filter by transportation type (subway, bus, rail, or ferry), as well as the specific line for the subway in order to 
        find information relevant to your commute.</li>
    <li>Every project page details its goals, budget, status, and projected completion date.</li>
    <li>You can also read more about the MBTA's Capital Investment Plan for fiscal year 2025 to 2029. This plan is updated annually in coordination with 
        MassDOT and the <a href="https://www.ctps.org/">Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization</a>. To get involved, check out the 
        <a href="https://www.ctps.org/calendar/month">MPO's meeting calendar</a>.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities">MBTA Communities Act</a>: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The MBTA Communities Act was adopted in January 2021, and requires 177 Cities and Towns to establish at least 1 district within a 
        half mile of public transportation (commuter rail, bus station, ferry terminal or subway) in which multi-family housing is permitted.
    </li>
    <li>The act also provides technical assistence via grant money to municipal planners. 
        Since August 2022, over $6 million in technical assistance has been provided to 156 municipalities.</li>
    <li>By upzoning around public transportation stations, the MBTA Communities Act should provide greater housing supply to these regions and increase accessibility to 
        transportation.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-unveils-4-billion-affordable-homes-act-to-increase-production-and-lower-costs">Affordable Homes Act</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Affordable Homes Act includes $4 billion in capital spending authorizations and 28 policy changes to address the 
        critical housing supply shortage.</li>
    <li>Crucially, it will fund the creation of more than 40,000 homes, including more than 22,000 new homes for low-income households 
        and more than 12,000 homes for middle-income households.</li>
    <li>It will also rehabilitate or make improvements improvements to 12,000 homes for low-income households, provide support for more than 11,000 moderate income 
        households, and fund accessibility improvements for approximately 4,500 homes.</li>
    <li>By increasing housing supply, this multi-billion dollar initiative may provide renters with more affordable options, alleviating the trade-off between rent cost 
        and commute time.</li>
    <li>As stated in the website, you can <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator">contact your legislative representative</a> to voice your support</li>
