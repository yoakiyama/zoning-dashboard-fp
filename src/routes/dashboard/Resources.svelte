<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>
    We hope that navigating our visualization helped provide you with some insight into how your access to high-paying jobs may currently be limited. Perhaps
    you were surprised by how long of a commute you would have to the Boston city center if you wanted to keep your rent at a price you're comfortable with.
    Our goal in creating this visualization was to help Boston area residents understand how they may be paying for access to higher paying jobs, either
    directly via high rent prices, or indirectly by spending hours of each day commuting to and from work.
    By getting a high-level understanding of the interplay between rent prices, commute times, and available salaries, we hope you're left with some sense
    of how the current housing crisis in Boston might be affecting you personally.
</p>

<p>
    Today, more than half of the residents in Boston are considered rent burdened<sup><a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report">1</a></sup>,
    raising the question of what can be done to improve housing affordability and accessibility to all parts of Boston. While any solution that helps
    bring down housing costs or increase transit options will undoubtedly take a long time, every change has to start somewhere. It's easy to be wary
    of new legislations that change the status quo, but if we want to alleviate the current situation, we have to start somewhere, and we hope you might
    now be more motivated to think holistcally about future legislation before reacting critically. Below we list some current and proposed legislations
    if you're interested in learning more, but please also feel free to continue to explore the fully-featured dashboard by clicking on the "Dashboard"

<h2>Further resources: learn how you can get involved</h2>
<p>
    You can learn more about proposed legislation and housing policies, as well as ways to get involved, by exploring the resources below.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mapc.org/get-involved/legislative-priorities/#housing">MAPC Legislative Priorities</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Metropolitan Area Planning Commission's (MAPC) housing legislative agenda includes initiatives and recommenations for updates to 
        housing construction, zoning, subsidies, transportation, and renter protections.</li>
    <li>Here, you can find important information about the MAPC's Fiscal and Budget Priorities, which include the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (MRVP) 
        and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The MRVP provides rent vouchers, which can be an important resource for highly 
        cost-burdened households (those who are paying over 50% of their income in rent) and homeless families. The MBTA is systematically underfunded, 
        which has led to widespread safety concerns as well as common and substantial delays. The MAPC will focus on advocating for additional funding for the MBTA 
        to address repairs and ensure regular service.

<ul>
    <li>Here, you can find all ongoing, recently completed, and contract awarded MBTA projects.</li>
    <li>You can filter by transportation type (subway, bus, rail, or ferry), as well as the specific line for the subway in order to 
        find information relevant to your commute.</li>
    <li>Every project page details its goals, budget, status, and projected completion date.</li>
    <li>You can also read more about the MBTA's Capital Investment Plan for fiscal year 2025 to 2029. This plan is updated annually in coordination with 
        MassDOT and the <a href="https://www.ctps.org/">Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization</a>. To get involved, check out the

<p><a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities">MBTA Communities Act</a>: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The MBTA Communities Act was adopted in January 2021, and requires 177 Cities and Towns to establish at least 1 district within a 
        half mile of public transportation (commuter rail, bus station, ferry terminal or subway) in which multi-family housing is permitted.
    </li>
    <li>The act also provides technical assistence via grant money to municipal planners. 
        Since August 2022, over $6 million in technical assistance has been provided to 156 municipalities.</li>
    <li>By upzoning around public transportation stations, the MBTA Communities Act should provide greater housing supply to these regions and increase accessibility to 
        transportation.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-unveils-4-billion-affordable-homes-act-to-increase-production-and-lower-costs">Affordable Homes Act</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Affordable Homes Act includes $4 billion in capital spending authorizations and 28 policy changes to address the 
        critical housing supply shortage.</li>
    <li>Crucially, it will fund the creation of more than 40,000 homes, including more than 22,000 new homes for low-income households 
        and more than 12,000 homes for middle-income households.</li>
    <li>It will also rehabilitate or make improvements improvements to 12,000 homes for low-income households, provide support for more than 11,000 moderate income 
        households, and fund accessibility improvements for approximately 4,500 homes.</li>
    <li>By increasing housing supply, this multi-billion dollar initiative may provide renters with more affordable options, alleviating the trade-off between rent cost 
        and commute time.</li>
    <li>As stated in the website, you can <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator">contact your legislative representative</a> to voice your support</li>

   <a href="https://www.topa4ma.org/">Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA)</a>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A proposed state-wide bill that would give municipalities the ability to adopt a "tenant opportunity to purchase".
        </li>
        <li>
            This right would allow tenants to make a first offer to purchase property they live in when a landlord looks to sell the property,
            giving tenant associations the opportunity to collectively purchase their homes instead of being displaced in the event of a sale.
        </li>
        <li>
            While tenant opportunities to purchase are cost-neutral, i.e. they neither bring in revenue or require expenditure from the government,
            they can help maintain a stock of affordable housing.
        </li>
        <li>
            By allowing tenant associations to make offers on the buildings they live in, property owners can still sell their properties at
            fair market prices, but without the likely subsequent increase in rent costs that often comes with corporate ownership of rental
            properties.
        </li>
        <li>
            By prseserving stock of affordable housing and avoiding displacement of tenants, TOPA could help prevent rental cost increases,
            and in the long term be a valuable contributor to allowing individuals to live closer to their work while paying a reasonable rent.
